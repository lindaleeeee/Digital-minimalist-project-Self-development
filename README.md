Digital Minimalist Project — Self-Development OS

A fully documented self-development operating system, built with product-thinking tools such as PRD, SRS, JTBD, VPS, and TAM-SAM-SOM.
This repository is my attempt to design my own life like a product — clear specifications, measurable goals, structured workflows, and AI-powered automation.

👀 What this repository is

This repo is a complete documentation system for building a personal self-development engine, consisting of:

📘 PRD (Product Requirements Document)

Defines the “product” I am building —
not software, but myself and my life systems.

Contains:

Core problems (cognitive overload, low consistency, fragmented routines)

Product goals (clarity, automation, measurable improvement)

Success metrics

User stories (my different modes: worker, creator, learner, investor)

📗 SRS (Software Requirements Specification)

Translates the PRD into spec-level behavior of my Self-Development OS, including:

Habit loop architecture

Daily/weekly routines

Learning pipeline

Emotional log & reflection system

Automation triggers (Telegram bot, Make, Sheets, Gemini)

Data schema for tracking progress

📙 JTBD Analysis

Clarifies why my self-development system exists.
Examples:

“I want to improve not just knowledge, but execution.”

“I need routines that continue even on low-energy days.”

“I want a system that reduces mental load, not increases it.”

📕 VPS / Value Proposition Sheets

Defines how each module in the OS delivers value:

Habit engine

Goal engine

Emotional reflection

Learning pipeline

Finance & health tracking

AI-supported automation tools

📒 TAM–SAM–SOM

A strategic exploration of:

Who benefits from a Self-Development OS

Market-size view for future service/productization

Possibilities of turning this into a generalizable “life system template”

🧠 What I'm trying to build

A Life Operating System that:

Tracks behaviors, goals, emotions, health, and knowledge

Automates low-level decisions

Reduces cognitive overload

Improves consistency

Turns journaling + habits into data-driven insights

Integrates AI as a collaborative agent

This repo documents every part of that journey, from problem definition to system design.

🛠 How I build

Write specs first → build later

Automate as soon as patterns emerge

Capture everything in structured documents

Review weekly → improve → re-design

Use AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Cursor) as a “co-designer”

🙌 Why this matters

Most self-development efforts fail because they are emotional, ad-hoc, or unclear.
This project is an experiment to treat life improvement like a repeatable, traceable, designable product.
