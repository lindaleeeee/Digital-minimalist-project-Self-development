# The Global App Market: Post-2020 Trends and User Insights

## Market Size and Growth Trends (2020–2025)

The global mobile app market has expanded dramatically since 2020. In 2024, worldwide annual app revenue reached **$522.7 billion**, up nearly 12% from 2023[[1]](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/mobile-app-market-statistics#:~:text=The%20mobile%20app%20market%20is,according%20to%20research%20by%20Statista). By 2025, global app revenues are projected around **$585 billion**, continuing an annual growth rate in the high single to low double digits[[2]](https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/mobile-apps/mobile-app-market-forecast#:~:text=Global%20Market%20Size%20and%20Growth,2024%E2%80%932025). This growth follows a pandemic-era surge in mobile usage – the market more than tripled in size from 2017’s $155 billion to 2024’s half-trillion level[[3]](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/mobile-app-market-statistics#:~:text=2010s%20and%20into%20the%202020s). Statista forecasts it will further rise to about **$674 billion by 2027**[[3]](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/mobile-app-market-statistics#:~:text=2010s%20and%20into%20the%202020s). In terms of user activity, downloads and usage have also climbed: consumers worldwide downloaded roughly **257 billion apps in 2023**, a number expected to reach **299 billion by 2025** (about +16% in two years)[[4]](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/productivity-apps-market-117791#:~:text=,adoption%20of%20digital%20productivity%20tools). Engagement is likewise at all-time highs, with mobile users spending an estimated **4.2 trillion hours in apps in 2024**[[5]](https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/mobile-apps/mobile-app-market-forecast#:~:text=more%20time%20in%20apps%20than,ever). Overall, the post-2020 landscape shows robust **growth in both revenue (8–12% YoY)** and adoption, cementing mobile apps as a cornerstone of the digital economy[[6]](https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/mobile-apps/mobile-app-market-forecast#:~:text=The%20mobile%20app%20industry%20isn%E2%80%99t,Statista%2C%202025).

Several factors drive this expansion. **Mobile advertising** has become a massive revenue engine – ads contributed about 65% of total app income in 2024[[7]](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/mobile-app-market-statistics#:~:text=Image%3A%20__wf_reserved_inherit). The shift to remote work and online services during COVID-19 also boosted demand for apps in communication, productivity, and entertainment domains[[8]](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/productivity-apps-market-117791#:~:text=Productivity%20apps%20Industry%20Had%20a,19%20Pandemic)[[9]](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/productivity-apps-market-117791#:~:text=The%20shift%20to%20remote%20work,hybrid%20and%20faraway%20paintings%20eventualities). Even as in-person activities resume, mobile habits formed in 2020 persist, keeping growth momentum. Looking ahead, analysts expect a **7–8% CAGR** through the latter 2020s, with the market size possibly topping $750–800 billion by 2029[[10]](https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/mobile-apps/mobile-app-market-forecast#:~:text=Long). In short, the global app market has shown strong **post-2020 growth** and is on track for continued expansion in the mid-2020s.

## Breakdown by App Category

Not all app categories grow equally – revenue and usage trends vary across different app types. Gaming and social media dominate overall revenue (nearly two-thirds combined), but this report focuses on categories aligned with “life simplification” and personal improvement:

### Productivity Apps

**Productivity apps** (e.g. to-do lists, note-taking, calendars, collaboration tools) have seen steady growth as users seek efficiency. The global productivity apps market was about **$9.65 billion in 2024** and is on pace to grow ~9% annually, reaching $18+ billion by 2030[[11]](https://www.cognitivemarketresearch.com/productivity-apps-market-report#:~:text=Apps%2C%20Others%29%2C%20by%20Application%20,ta). This category got a boost from the remote-work shift – demand for project management, team communication, and cloud storage apps surged during 2020 and remained high[[12]](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/productivity-apps-market-117791#:~:text=Productivity%20apps%20Industry%20Had%20a,19%20Pandemic)[[9]](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/productivity-apps-market-117791#:~:text=The%20shift%20to%20remote%20work,hybrid%20and%20faraway%20paintings%20eventualities). Key players like Microsoft Teams, Slack, Trello, Evernote, and Notion have expanded their user bases. Trends include integration of **AI features** into productivity suites (e.g. smart scheduling, content generation) to streamline workflows[[13]](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/productivity-apps-market-117791#:~:text=integration%20of%20generative%20AI%20to,Drive%20Market%20Growth)[[14]](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/productivity-apps-market-117791#:~:text=minimal%20user%20enter,among%20groups%20and%20individuals%20alike). In 2023–2024, major platforms introduced AI assistants (Microsoft 365 Copilot, Notion AI, etc.) to automate tasks and boost output[[13]](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/productivity-apps-market-117791#:~:text=integration%20of%20generative%20AI%20to,Drive%20Market%20Growth)[[14]](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/productivity-apps-market-117791#:~:text=minimal%20user%20enter,among%20groups%20and%20individuals%20alike). As a result, productivity apps are increasingly viewed as essential work tools, and their usage continues climbing. North America and Europe lead in adoption (over 70% of productivity app revenue comes from these regions)[[15]](https://www.cognitivemarketresearch.com/productivity-apps-market-report#:~:text=%28CAGR%29%20of%209.00,to%202031), but Asia–Pacific is the fastest-growing market (11%+ CAGR) as smartphone and cloud adoption rise[[16]](https://www.cognitivemarketresearch.com/productivity-apps-market-report#:~:text=,from%202024%20to%202031). Overall, productivity apps show healthy growth as users embrace digital tools to **organize tasks and save time**.

### Self-Development and Personal Growth Apps

Apps for **self-development** – covering personal growth, education, mental wellness, and skills – have become very popular post-2020. This includes meditation and mindfulness apps, language learning, coaching platforms, and other self-improvement tools. The broader **self-improvement industry** (across books, courses, apps, etc.) was valued around **$10–11 billion globally in the early 2020s**[[17]](https://zipdo.co/self-improvement-industry-statistics/#:~:text=Verified%20Data%20Points)[[18]](https://zipdo.co/self-improvement-industry-statistics/#:~:text=The%20booming%20self,personal%20growth%20and%20mental%20wellness), and is growing ~5–6% annually[[19]](https://zipdo.co/self-improvement-industry-statistics/#:~:text=productivity%2C%20and%20spirituality)[[18]](https://zipdo.co/self-improvement-industry-statistics/#:~:text=The%20booming%20self,personal%20growth%20and%20mental%20wellness). Mobile apps are a key driver: over **50% of self-improvement app users engage with motivational or self-help content daily**[[20]](https://zipdo.co/self-improvement-industry-statistics/#:~:text=45%25%20of%20self,occurs%20via%20videos)[[21]](https://zipdo.co/self-improvement-industry-statistics/#:~:text=match%20at%20L414%20,improvement%20book%20buyers%20is%2035), indicating high user engagement.

Within this space, **wellness and mental health apps** saw a boom after 2020. Meditation and mindfulness apps (like Calm, Headspace, Fabulous) surged as people coped with stress – the global wellness app market reached **$11–12 billion in 2024**[[22]](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/wellness-apps-market-report#:~:text=2030%20www,from%202025%20to%202030). While top meditation apps have faced some slowdown from their 2020 peak (the wellness app segment generated an estimated $880 million in 2024, marking a slight decline for major apps)[[23]](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wellness-app-market/#:~:text=There%27s%20also%20self%20care%20and,Wellness%20App%20Revenue), the overall trend remains upward. Forecasts show the **wellness apps market** (spanning fitness, nutrition, self-care, etc.) could quadruple by the early 2030s – e.g. projected ~$45 billion by 2034[[24]](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/wellness-apps-market#:~:text=Wellness%20Apps%20Market%20Size%20to,a%20robust%20CAGR%20of). Likewise, the subset of **mental health apps** (for therapy, mood tracking, etc.) is expected to grow from about **$7.5 billion in 2025 to $23–24 billion by 2032**[[25]](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/mental-health-apps-market-109012#:~:text=,80%20billion%20by%202032), an extremely rapid expansion.

**Education and skill-building apps** also contribute to this category’s growth. Language learning apps (Duolingo, Babbel), brain training, and other personal development tools gained millions of new users during lockdowns. Many maintained their popularity post-pandemic as users continue to pursue self-improvement via mobile. In summary, **self-development apps are thriving**, fueled by consumer focus on mental wellness, lifelong learning, and personal growth. High engagement metrics (daily use, long session times) underscore that users are incorporating these apps into their routines for betterment and habit change[[20]](https://zipdo.co/self-improvement-industry-statistics/#:~:text=45%25%20of%20self,occurs%20via%20videos)[[26]](https://zipdo.co/self-improvement-industry-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%2065,practitioners%20report%20greater%20life%20satisfaction).

### Automation and Workflow Apps

Apps focused on **automation, integration, and workflow streamlining** are an emerging category geared toward simplifying digital life. These include personal automation tools (like IFTTT, Zapier mobile integrations, Siri Shortcuts/Google Routines) as well as the new wave of **AI-powered assistants**. The newest frontier here is **generative AI**: 2023 saw explosive adoption of AI chatbots for productivity. Notably, OpenAI’s ChatGPT reached an estimated **800+ million weekly users** by late 2023[[27]](https://ai4sp.org/why-only-2-percent-of-ai-users-save-100s-of-hours-and-you-are-not/#:~:text=The%20Reality%20Check%3A) – a staggering uptake that highlights demand for AI helpers in daily tasks. Many users leverage ChatGPT or similar AI apps to automate writing, research, and other repetitive work, effectively turning these apps into “digital co-workers.” Enterprise surveys show over half of employees want more AI tools to simplify and automate their workflow[[28]](https://www.unily.com/about/newsroom/the-ai-reality-check#:~:text=%2A%20One,to%20simplify%20the%20digital%20workplace). In response, platforms like Microsoft and Google have integrated AI agents into office apps (e.g. AI scheduling meetings, summarizing emails)[[13]](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/productivity-apps-market-117791#:~:text=integration%20of%20generative%20AI%20to,Drive%20Market%20Growth)[[14]](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/productivity-apps-market-117791#:~:text=minimal%20user%20enter,among%20groups%20and%20individuals%20alike).

While “automation apps” per se is a niche, the trend is that **automation features** are being embedded in various productivity and utility apps. Additionally, standalone task automation apps (for managing smart homes, automating phone tasks, etc.) have a loyal user base, though smaller. For instance, **workflow automation services** like Zapier report millions of integrations run per month, and Apple’s Shortcuts app (built-in on iOS) executes billions of automated actions annually (Apple noted growing usage of Shortcuts as users set up custom routines). These tools reflect the growing user intent to **save time by delegating tasks to software**. We also see a rise of “all-in-one” workspace apps (Notion, Coda, etc.) that combine functions to reduce app-switching, essentially automating context switching. In sum, automation and workflow apps – often powered by AI – are on the rise, aligning with user desires for **streamlined, efficient digital workflows**. The massive adoption of ChatGPT and similar tools in 2023–2024 underscores this category’s momentum[[27]](https://ai4sp.org/why-only-2-percent-of-ai-users-save-100s-of-hours-and-you-are-not/#:~:text=The%20Reality%20Check%3A).

### Habit-Tracking and Habit-Building Apps

**Habit-building apps** (habit trackers, goal-setting and routine apps) have become popular as people aim to improve their daily behaviors. These apps help users form good habits (or break bad ones) by tracking activities, sending reminders, and visualizing progress. The global **habit tracking app market** was valued around **$1.7 billion in 2024**, with forecasts predicting it will grow to ~$5.5 billion by 2033 (roughly **14% CAGR**)[[29]](https://straitsresearch.com/report/habit-tracking-apps-market#:~:text=Habit%20Tracking%20Apps%20Market%20Size). This rapid growth is driven by rising interest in personal optimization and self-discipline, especially among Millennials and Gen Z[[30]](https://straitsresearch.com/report/habit-tracking-apps-market#:~:text=tracking%2C%20customizable%20goal,being). Many habit apps saw increased downloads in the early 2020s as individuals turned to digital tools for self-improvement during the pandemic.

Popular habit apps like Habitica, HabitBull, Streaks, and Loop, as well as multi-function planners like Todoist and Notion (which include habit features), have cultivated strong user communities. Notably, some wellness apps and productivity apps are integrating habit-forming features – for example, fitness apps adding habit streaks, or note-taking apps adding daily routine trackers. This blurs category lines but speaks to the demand: users want help building consistent routines in areas like exercise, study, meditation, or productivity. Trends in this space include **gamification** (achievements, virtual rewards for streaks) and **AI coaching**: developers are infusing AI-driven nudges and personalized tips to keep users on track[[31]](https://straitsresearch.com/report/habit-tracking-apps-market#:~:text=rising%20interest%20in%20personal%20development%2C,improvement%20and%20life)[[32]](https://straitsresearch.com/report/habit-tracking-apps-market#:~:text=Contextual%20Ai%20and%20Wearable%20Coaching,Redefine%20Digital%20Habit%20Formation). Moreover, employers have started embracing habit platforms for wellness (to encourage employee healthy habits and productivity), further boosting adoption[[33]](https://straitsresearch.com/report/habit-tracking-apps-market#:~:text=insights,being)[[34]](https://straitsresearch.com/report/habit-tracking-apps-market#:~:text=Market%20Growth%20Factor). In summary, habit-building apps occupy a growing niche – though still a smaller market in dollar terms, their influence is significant as millions use these tools to pursue **better habits and simplified routines**.

### Digital Wellbeing and Minimalism Apps

A distinct category aligned with “life simplification” is **digital wellbeing apps** – tools aimed at reducing screen time, minimizing distractions, and improving one’s relationship with technology. These include apps for phone usage tracking, focus and anti-distraction (like Forest, Freedom), app blockers, minimalist launchers, and “digital detox” aids. Interest in digital wellbeing has **risen markedly from 2020 onwards**, as many people became aware of screen overuse. In 2024, an estimated **40% of Americans were actively trying to cut down screen time**[[35]](https://www.castlepinesconnection.com/digital-minimalism-is-trending/#:~:text=Americans%20spend%20an%20average%20of,too%20dependent%20on%20their%20phones), according to a survey by a health IT firm. Over **52% felt they were too dependent on their phones**[[35]](https://www.castlepinesconnection.com/digital-minimalism-is-trending/#:~:text=Americans%20spend%20an%20average%20of,too%20dependent%20on%20their%20phones), indicating a widespread desire to dial back digital consumption. This user sentiment has driven popularity of minimalist phone setups and wellbeing apps. For example, Google and Apple both introduced enhanced built-in screen-time controls and focus modes in recent OS updates, reflecting consumer demand for fewer distractions.

While the **market size for digital wellbeing apps** is harder to quantify (many such features are built into devices, and standalone apps are often low-cost or free), usage is notable. Surveys show that **27% of digital minimalists use apps or settings to limit screen time** as a strategy to regain focus[[36]](https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/digital-minimalism-generational-insights/?srsltid=AfmBOoqL8Fj10pN9oDg7ih-XKlks-_DCR7ShqaleY2VV5KW4dlteoP25#:~:text=Image). Apps like One Sec (which forces a pause before launching social media) or Unpluq (which makes distracting apps harder to access) gained traction as users looked for tech solutions to combat tech overload[[37]](https://www.castlepinesconnection.com/digital-minimalism-is-trending/#:~:text=Several%20apps%20have%20been%20developed,real%20trees%20in%20African%20countries). However, monetization in this category is modest – the “wellness” app industry (including meditation and self-care apps) saw about **$0.88 billion revenue in 2024**[[23]](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wellness-app-market/#:~:text=There%27s%20also%20self%20care%20and,Wellness%20App%20Revenue), and a subset of that would be digital wellbeing-specific tools. Despite relatively low revenue, the qualitative impact is high: these apps align with the **digital minimalism trend**, wherein users seek simpler digital experiences. Notably, “digital detox” movements have gained steam – one survey of professionals found that fully **50% qualified as “at-risk” or “problematic” smartphone users** (overstimulated by their devices), reporting feelings of compulsion and dependency[[38]](https://www.castlepinesconnection.com/digital-minimalism-is-trending/#:~:text=Overstimulated%20adults%20are%20largely%20driving,feelings%20of%20dependency%20and%20compulsion). This realization is pushing many toward apps and practices that **simplify their digital life** (decluttering home screens, turning off notifications, scheduling device-free time, etc.[[39]](https://www.castlepinesconnection.com/digital-minimalism-is-trending/#:~:text=about%20themselves%2C%20according%20to%20digitalwellnesslab)). In essence, digital wellbeing apps cater to users’ growing desire for *fewer distractions, less app overload, and more mindful tech usage* – an important counterbalance to the proliferation of apps in every facet of life.

## User Motivations and Behavior Trends

A core theme in recent years is that users are not only downloading more apps, but also reflecting on how apps impact their lives. Several key **motivations and behavioral insights** have shaped the app market from the demand side:

### **App Overload and “Digital Fatigue”**

With app stores offering millions of choices, many people feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of apps and tools in their digital routines. Research confirms a sense of **app fatigue**: on average, smartphone owners have around 80 apps installed but use only ~9 daily[[40]](https://fortis-tele.com/how-text-messaging-is-evolving-in-the-app-saturated-era/#:~:text=The%20App%20Fatigue%20Factor). This indicates a long tail of unused or seldom-used apps cluttering devices. Both consumers and workers report frustration with juggling too many platforms:

- **34% of employees** at large enterprises say they feel *overwhelmed by having too many apps and tools* in the workplace[[28]](https://www.unily.com/about/newsroom/the-ai-reality-check#:~:text=%2A%20One,to%20simplify%20the%20digital%20workplace).
- **47% of workers** (in a 2025 survey) said that *too many different apps create information silos and hurt productivity*[[41]](https://www.giveriver.com/blog/workplace-communication-tools#:~:text=The%20challenge%20is%20greater%20in,that%20hurt%20productivity%20and%20satisfaction).
- Industry observers note that people “woke up to find they have too many devices, too many apps that do similar things,” leading to a push for consolidation and simpler solutions[[42]](https://www.unily.com/about/newsroom/the-ai-reality-check#:~:text=Unily%20www.unily.com%20%20Thirty,to%20simplify%20the%20digital)[[43]](https://kadence.co/news/kadence-the-first-workops-platform-defining-the-future-of-workplace-operations/#:~:text=Employees%20are%20overwhelmed%20by%20too,of%20workplace%20performance%20from).

This overload has given rise to the idea of consolidating functionality (all-in-one apps) and prioritizing only essential apps. For example, instead of using separate apps for messaging, tasks, and files, many now prefer integrated hubs (like Microsoft Teams or Notion) to reduce context-switching. App developers are responding by adding features outside their original scope (e.g. messaging in project tools, tasks in note apps) to capture users who want to do more in a single app ecosystem.

### **Desire for Simplicity and Digital Minimalism**

A counter-trend to app overload is **“digital minimalism,”** where users intentionally limit their app usage to reclaim focus and time. Multiple surveys in 2023–2024 show that a significant portion of users are seeking *simpler digital experiences with fewer distractions*. As mentioned, 40% of Americans surveyed were actively cutting back screen time[[35]](https://www.castlepinesconnection.com/digital-minimalism-is-trending/#:~:text=Americans%20spend%20an%20average%20of,too%20dependent%20on%20their%20phones). A similar global survey by ExpressVPN found **46% of Gen Z** and many across generations taking measures like app timers, do-not-disturb modes, and periodic detoxes to reduce tech’s mental toll[[44]](https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/digital-minimalism-generational-insights/?srsltid=AfmBOoqL8Fj10pN9oDg7ih-XKlks-_DCR7ShqaleY2VV5KW4dlteoP25#:~:text=Survey%3A%2046,It%27s%20a%20way)[[36]](https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/digital-minimalism-generational-insights/?srsltid=AfmBOoqL8Fj10pN9oDg7ih-XKlks-_DCR7ShqaleY2VV5KW4dlteoP25#:~:text=Image). The motivations cited include improving mental health, reducing stress, and increasing real-world engagement.

Concrete behaviors reflect this minimalism trend: **43% of self-identified digital minimalists** carve out specific periods with *no digital access* (e.g. no phone after 9pm), and **22%** have designated *tech-free zones* at home[[36]](https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/digital-minimalism-generational-insights/?srsltid=AfmBOoqL8Fj10pN9oDg7ih-XKlks-_DCR7ShqaleY2VV5KW4dlteoP25#:~:text=Image)[[45]](https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/digital-minimalism-generational-insights/?srsltid=AfmBOoqL8Fj10pN9oDg7ih-XKlks-_DCR7ShqaleY2VV5KW4dlteoP25#:~:text=very%20issues%20they%20create). Furthermore, **27% use screen-tracking or limiting apps** to monitor their usage[[36]](https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/digital-minimalism-generational-insights/?srsltid=AfmBOoqL8Fj10pN9oDg7ih-XKlks-_DCR7ShqaleY2VV5KW4dlteoP25#:~:text=Image). Users are even simplifying their devices by deleting non-essential apps and using “focus” launchers that offer only basic functions[[46]](https://www.castlepinesconnection.com/digital-minimalism-is-trending/#:~:text=Digital%20minimalism%20is%20about%20reclaiming,features%20like%20calling%20and%20texting). The rise of grayscale modes, notification batching, and even reversion to “dumb phones” are all part of this desire to declutter digitally[[46]](https://www.castlepinesconnection.com/digital-minimalism-is-trending/#:~:text=Digital%20minimalism%20is%20about%20reclaiming,features%20like%20calling%20and%20texting). In essence, a growing user segment is saying **“less is more”** when it comes to apps – they want technology to serve them, not overwhelm them. This has strategic implications for developers: apps that can demonstrate **simplicity, clarity of purpose, and help reduce cognitive load** resonate strongly with these users.

### **Streamlined Workflows and Integration**

Whether for personal life or work, many users now prioritize **streamlined workflows** – meaning they prefer apps that integrate well and simplify tasks, rather than having to hop between numerous specialized apps. In enterprise contexts, employees express a strong *preference for unified platforms*: over **50% of workers said they want AI and technology to help *simplify* their digital workplace** by connecting tools and automating steps[[28]](https://www.unily.com/about/newsroom/the-ai-reality-check#:~:text=%2A%20One,to%20simplify%20the%20digital%20workplace). This is driving an uptick in software integrations and “platform” approaches. For example, the adoption of automation connectors (Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate) is in part due to users wanting their calendar, email, task list, and notes all syncing and triggering actions automatically.

Surveys in the fintech sector similarly showed that **57.5% of consumers manage with just one financial app**, while those who use multiple apps do so only because no single app had all features they needed[[47]](https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/105746/why-do-consumers-hold-multiple-financial-apps#:~:text=Why%20do%20consumers%20hold%20multiple,Industry%20Implications%20The). This indicates that when possible, people gravitate to an all-in-one solution. The success of super-apps in some markets (e.g. WeChat, which offers chat, payments, booking, etc. in one) exemplifies this desire for one app to rule them all, reducing the friction of switching. In productivity, the rise of comprehensive suites (Office 365, Google Workspace) over isolated tools also reflects integration demand – users benefit when communication, file editing, and meetings happen in a connected environment.

From a behavioral standpoint, **efficiency and focus** are key motivations. Users feel *overwhelm from context switching* and missing information across many apps. Simplifying the workflow – either via choosing fewer apps or via tighter integration – alleviates that. As one workplace study noted, having too many disparate apps can cause important messages or data to be siloed and missed, so consolidation improves both productivity and satisfaction[[41]](https://www.giveriver.com/blog/workplace-communication-tools#:~:text=The%20challenge%20is%20greater%20in,that%20hurt%20productivity%20and%20satisfaction). We also see more individuals leveraging **automation bots** (as discussed above) to connect apps behind the scenes – for instance, automatically creating a task in a to-do app when an email is flagged, saving the user from manually using two apps. All these trends underscore a common user intent: a *smoother, more unified digital experience* where technology feels seamless. Tools that promise to “bring everything into one place” or “automate the busywork” tap directly into this motivation.

User behavior insights come from 2024–2025 surveys, including an enterprise digital workplace report by Unily[[28]](https://www.unily.com/about/newsroom/the-ai-reality-check#:~:text=%2A%20One,to%20simplify%20the%20digital%20workplace), workplace tool surveys[[41]](https://www.giveriver.com/blog/workplace-communication-tools#:~:text=The%20challenge%20is%20greater%20in,that%20hurt%20productivity%20and%20satisfaction), and consumer studies on digital minimalism and device use[[35]](https://www.castlepinesconnection.com/digital-minimalism-is-trending/#:~:text=Americans%20spend%20an%20average%20of,too%20dependent%20on%20their%20phones)[[40]](https://fortis-tele.com/how-text-messaging-is-evolving-in-the-app-saturated-era/#:~:text=The%20App%20Fatigue%20Factor). These sources collectively show that the global app economy is large and growing, but also that users are increasingly mindful of how they use apps – seeking **greater productivity and personal growth, while also craving simplicity to avoid overwhelm**. The post-2020 period has been defined by this dynamic interplay between **more apps** and a call for *better (not just more) apps* – those that enrich lives without adding friction.

# 디지털 업무 도구 사용 증가와 피로 현상: 지역·산업·직무별 분석

## 서론: 디지털 의존도의 상승과 피로감 대두

오늘날 전 세계 직장인들은 업무에 다수의 디지털 도구와 플랫폼을 사용하며 그 의존도가 지속적으로 높아지고 있습니다. **미국 직장인**의 경우 하루 평균 9개의 애플리케이션을 업무에 활용하고 있는데[hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/notification-fatigue-productivity-asana/623419/#:~:text=likely%20to%20report%20feeling%20the,between%20apps%20tanked%20their%20productivity), 이러한 “툴 다변화”로 인해 업무 간 전환이 잦아지고 있습니다. 글로벌 설문조사에 따르면 **근로자의 55%**는 하루 3~5개의 업무 툴에 로그인하고, **31%**는 6~10개에 달하는 툴을 사용한다고 합니다[hcamag.com](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/tool-fatigue-why-digital-platforms-arent-delivering/555463#:~:text=Tool%20fatigue%20refers%20to%20the,average%20workday%20spans%20multiple%20platforms). 그만큼 **업무 효율을 높이기 위한 디지털 도구 활용이 일상화**되었지만, 동시에 **플랫폼 간 빈번한 전환과 알림**으로 인한 피로감도 커지고 있습니다. 실제로 직원들은 매일 평균 33회 탭이나 앱을 전환하고, 17%는 **하루 100회 이상** 플랫폼을 오가며 일한다고 답했습니다[hcamag.com](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/tool-fatigue-why-digital-platforms-arent-delivering/555463#:~:text=while%2031,to%2010%20tools%20a%20day).

이러한 잦은 **디지털 컨텍스트 전환**은 업무 생산성에 부정적 영향을 주고 있습니다. 한 조사에서는 **직원들이 주당 평균 51분**을 이른바 “툴 피로(tool fatigue)”로 잃고 있다고 하였는데, 이는 연간 **44시간 이상의 업무 손실**에 해당합니다[hcamag.com](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/tool-fatigue-why-digital-platforms-arent-delivering/555463#:~:text=Employees%20are%20losing%20over%2044,it%20negatively%20affects%20their%20work). 나아가 22%의 직원은 주당 2시간 이상(연 100시간 이상)을 툴 피로로 낭비하고 있다고 응답했습니다[hcamag.com](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/tool-fatigue-why-digital-platforms-arent-delivering/555463#:~:text=per%20year). 디지털 도구의 **과잉 사용이 업무 몰입도를 떨어뜨리고 업무 시간을 실제 일보다 관리·조율에 더 쓰게 만드는 현상**이 전 세계적으로 보고되고 있습니다.

**번아웃(Burnout)** 역시 디지털 업무 환경과 맞물려 나타나는 중요한 이슈입니다. Asana의 글로벌 조사에 따르면 지난 1년간 **63%의 근로자가 번아웃을 경험**했다고 답했는데, 이는 비록 전년(71%)보다 다소 낮아진 수치지만 여전히 매우 높은 수준입니다[nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/asana-anatomy-of-work-index-2022:-work-about-work-hampering-organizational-agility#:~:text=notifications%2C%20burnout%20remains%20a%20persistent,being). 특히 **MZ세대**의 번아웃이 심각하여 Z세대 응답자의 84%가 1년 내 번아웃을 겪었다고 보고되었고[nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/asana-anatomy-of-work-index-2022:-work-about-work-hampering-organizational-agility#:~:text=notifications%2C%20burnout%20remains%20a%20persistent,being), **업무와 생활 경계의 모호화**도 두드러졌습니다. 전체 응답자의 37%는 **뚜렷한 출퇴근 시간 없이** 일하고 있다고 답했으며[nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/asana-anatomy-of-work-index-2022:-work-about-work-hampering-organizational-agility#:~:text=While%20employees%20are%20missing%20fewer,person%20collaboration), 이러한 경향은 재택·하이브리드 근무 확산과 늘어난 디지털 연결이 한 요인으로 지목됩니다.

결국 **디지털 도구의 양날의 검**이 나타나고 있습니다. 업무 생산성과 협업을 높이는 데 필수적인 툴들이지만, **“너무 많은 디지털(too much digital)”은 오히려 업무 효율 저하와 직원 피로를 초래하는 역효과**가 나타나는 것입니다[deloitte.com](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/telecommunications/connectivity-mobile-trends-survey/2023/connected-consumers-digital-fatigue.html#:~:text=Digital%20life%20often%20delivers%20daily,being%20worries). 다음으로는 지역별, 산업별, 직무별로 이러한 현상이 어떻게 나타나는지 살펴보겠습니다.

## 지역별: 아시아 vs 서구권의 도구 사용 패턴과 피로

### 아시아: **한국, 일본, 동남아**의 사례

아시아 지역은 세계에서 손꼽히는 **디지털 기술 수용도가 높은 시장**입니다. **한국**의 경우 디지털 기기 활용 시간이 매우 길어, 한 조사에 따르면 스마트폰·PC 등 **디지털 기기 일평균 사용 시간이 5시간 이상**으로 나타났습니다[thevaluenews.co.kr](https://www.thevaluenews.co.kr/news/185630#:~:text=%ED%95%98%EB%A3%A8%EC%9D%98%20%EC%8B%9C%EC%9E%91%EB%B6%80%ED%84%B0%20%EB%A7%88%EB%AC%B4%EB%A6%AC%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94%20%EC%88%9C%EA%B0%84%EA%B9%8C%EC%A7%80%20%EC%9A%B0%EB%A6%AC%EB%8A%94,%EB%8A%98%20%EB%94%94%EC%A7%80%ED%84%B8%EA%B8%B0%EA%B8%B0%EB%A5%BC%20%EB%8B%A4%EB%A3%A8%EB%A9%B0%20%EC%83%9D%ED%99%9C%ED%95%9C%EB%8B%A4). 직장인만 놓고 보면 하루 8시간 근무 중 상당 부분을 컴퓨터 화면 앞에서 보내므로 이 수치는 더욱 높아질 것입니다. 과도한 화면 노출로 **눈의 피로, 수면 장애** 등을 호소하는 사례도 많아졌습니다[thevaluenews.co.kr](https://www.thevaluenews.co.kr/news/185630#:~:text=Image%3A%20%EC%A7%81%EC%9E%A5%EC%9D%B8%20%ED%95%98%EB%A3%A8%20%ED%8F%89%EA%B7%A0%20%EB%94%94%EC%A7%80%ED%84%B8%EA%B8%B0%EA%B8%B0,%EC%9E%A5%EC%95%A0%20%EB%93%B1%EC%9D%98%20%EB%AC%B8%EC%A0%9C%EB%A5%BC%20%EC%9D%BC%EC%9C%BC%ED%82%A4%EA%B8%B0%EB%8F%84%20%ED%95%9C%EB%8B%A4). 업무 측면에서 보면, 한국 직장인들은 **반복적인 행정 업무에 전체 근로시간의 44%**를 소비하고 있다는 분석이 있습니다[zdnet.co.kr](https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20250801233539#:~:text=%EB%B3%B4%EA%B3%A0%EC%84%9C%EB%8A%94%20%EA%B5%AD%EB%82%B4%20%EC%A0%84%EC%9D%BC%EC%A0%9C%C2%B7%EC%8B%9C%EA%B0%84%EC%A0%9C%20%EC%82%AC%EB%AC%B4%20%EA%B7%BC%EB%A1%9C%EC%9E%90%EB%93%A4%EC%9D%B4,%EC%97%85%EB%AC%B4%20%EC%88%98%ED%96%89%EC%9D%B4%20%EC%A0%9C%ED%95%9C%EB%90%9C%20%EA%B2%83%EC%9C%BC%EB%A1%9C%20%EB%82%98%ED%83%80%EB%82%AC%EB%8B%A4). 보고서 작성, 자료 입력 등의 비핵심 업무가 절반 가까이를 차지하면서 정작 **전략 수립이나 창의적 과업에는 충분한 시간을 쓰지 못하는 현실**입니다[zdnet.co.kr](https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20250801233539#:~:text=Image%20%EC%9D%B8%EA%B3%B5%EC%A7%80%EB%8A%A5,%28%EC%82%AC%EC%A7%84%3D%EA%B5%AC%EA%B8%80%EC%A0%9C%EB%AF%B8%EB%82%98%EC%9D%B4). 이는 한국이 세계 최고 수준의 IT 인프라를 갖추고 있음에도 불구하고 **디지털 툴이 업무를 완전히 자동화해주지 못해 오히려 업무량과 피로가 남아 있다**는 점을 보여줍니다. 실제 한국 응답자 10명 중 3명은 “만약 추가로 시간을 확보한다면 우선 **업무량을 줄이는 데** 쓰고 싶다”고 답했는데, 이는 반복 업무 누적으로 인한 피로가 상당함을 나타냅니다[zdnet.co.kr](https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20250801233539#:~:text=%EA%B5%AD%EB%82%B4%20%EC%9D%91%EB%8B%B5%EC%9E%90%EB%8A%94%20%EC%B6%94%EA%B0%80%20%EC%97%85%EB%AC%B4%20%EC%8B%9C%EA%B0%84,%EC%9D%B8%ED%95%9C%20%ED%94%BC%EB%A1%9C%EA%B0%80%20%EC%83%81%EB%8B%B9%ED%95%98%EB%8B%A4%EB%8A%94%20%EC%A6%9D%EA%B1%B0%EB%9D%BC%EA%B3%A0%20%EB%B6%84%EC%84%9D%ED%96%88%EB%8B%A4). 한편 한국인들은 신기술 활용에도 적극적이어서 **55%가 매주 4시간을 아껴준다면 AI를 도입하겠다**고 답해 글로벌 평균(39%)보다 훨씬 높았고, **“AI는 절대 사용하지 않겠다”는 응답도 9%로 전세계 평균(28%)보다 낮았습니다[zdnet.co.kr](https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20250801233539#:~:text=%ED%95%A0%EC%95%A0%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94%20%EC%8B%9C%EA%B0%84%EB%8F%84%20%EC%A0%84%EC%B2%B4%20%EC%97%85%EB%AC%B4%20%EC%A4%91,%EC%A0%88%EB%B0%98%EC%97%90%20%EB%AF%B8%EC%B9%98%EC%A7%80%20%EB%AA%BB%ED%96%88%EB%8B%A4)**. 이는 **업무 자동화를 통해 디지털 피로를 줄이고자 하는 기대감**이 한국에서 특히 크다는 의미로 해석됩니다.

일본의 경우, **업무 문화**와 디지털 도구 사용에서 한국과 미묘한 차이가 있습니다. Asana의 조사에 따르면 **일본 근로자들은 불필요한 회의에 주당 2시간만 할애해**, 이것이 조사 대상국 중 최저치였습니다[nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/asana-anatomy-of-work-index-2022:-work-about-work-hampering-organizational-agility#:~:text=spent%20on%20strategy%20has%20also,about%20work%20has%20decreased%20globally). 회의 문화가 비교적 효율적으로 운영되거나, 불필요한 미팅을 최소화하려는 경향이 반영된 것으로 보입니다. 반면 **싱가포르**를 비롯한 일부 동남아 국가는 **업무 조율에 매우 많은 시간**을 쓰고 있는 것으로 나타났는데, 싱가포르 근로자의 경우 업무시간의 **69%를 이메일, 보고 정리 등 “워크 어바웃 워크(work about work)”에 소비**하여 이 비율이 글로벌 최고치였습니다[nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/asana-anatomy-of-work-index-2022:-work-about-work-hampering-organizational-agility#:~:text=compared%20to%20other%20markets%20,and%20miss%20the%20fewest%20deadlines). 이는 싱가포르 등의 **지식노동자들이 과도한 디지털 업무 절차로 인한 비효율을 겪고 있음**을 시사합니다. 이러한 부담을 줄이기 위해 **동남아 기업들도 업무 툴 통합과 프로세스 혁신을 적극 검토**하고 있습니다.

### 북미: **미국**의 극단적 연결과 번아웃

**미국**은 디지털 업무 문화가 가장 발달한 동시에 **업무와 삶의 경계 붕괴**가 두드러진 사례로 꼽힙니다. Asana 보고서에 따르면 미국 근로자의 **63%가 퇴근 후에도 업무 이메일을 확인**하며, 이는 조사 대상 국가 중 가장 높은 비율이었습니다[hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/notification-fatigue-productivity-asana/623419/#:~:text=,a%20day%20to%20get%20tasks). 또한 미국인 62%는 **업무 시간 외에도 즉각적으로 이메일 등에 답변해야 한다는 압박**을 느낀다고 답했는데, 이러한 수치는 다른 국가들보다 월등히 높아 **항상 연결된(always-on)** 문화가 강함을 보여줍니다[hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/notification-fatigue-productivity-asana/623419/#:~:text=workers%20continue%20to%20check%20their,about%2010%20apps%20a%20day). 게다가 이러한 **24/7 연결 상태**는 젊은 세대일수록 더 심각해서, MZ세대 미국 직원들은 상사나 동료의 메시지에 **실시간 응답해야 할 것 같은 압박감**을 크게 느끼는 것으로 나타났습니다[hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/notification-fatigue-productivity-asana/623419/#:~:text=,a%20day%20to%20get%20tasks).

미국 직장인들은 다양한 생산성 툴과 협업 앱을 적극 도입해 **평균 9개의 앱을 사용**하고 있으며, 관리자급은 **하루 10개 이상** 툴을 쓰는 것으로 조사되었습니다[hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/notification-fatigue-productivity-asana/623419/#:~:text=likely%20to%20report%20feeling%20the,between%20apps%20tanked%20their%20productivity). 2021년에는 이 수치가 13개까지 보고되었으나 2022년 다소 줄어든 9~10개 수준이었고, 이는 일부 툴 통합 움직임이 반영된 결과로 보입니다[hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/notification-fatigue-productivity-asana/623419/#:~:text=likely%20to%20report%20feeling%20the,between%20apps%20tanked%20their%20productivity). 그럼에도 불구하고 **잦은 앱 전환으로 인한 부작용**이 뚜렷합니다. 미국 응답자의 19%는 **여러 앱을 오가느라 주의력이 떨어진다**고 답했고, 17%는 **업무 앱 사이를 왔다갔다 하느라 근무 시간이 늘어났다**고 토로했습니다[hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/notification-fatigue-productivity-asana/623419/#:~:text=large%20companies%20tended%20to%20use,less%20efficient%20at%20their%20job). 전체적으로도 **5명 중 1명(21%)이 앱 전환 때문에 업무 효율이 떨어졌다고 인정**하였습니다[hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/notification-fatigue-productivity-asana/623419/#:~:text=,less%20efficient%20at%20their%20job).

이러한 배경에서 미국에서는 **번아웃 발생 빈도**도 높게 나타납니다. 조사에 따르면 미국 근로자는 지난 1년간 평균 **2.3회의 번아웃**을 경험했는데, 이는 글로벌 최고 수준입니다[nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/asana-anatomy-of-work-index-2022:-work-about-work-hampering-organizational-agility#:~:text=,year%20%E2%80%94%20the%20highest%20globally). 계속되는 **디지털 알림, 회의, 업무 조율 작업** 등이 직원들의 정신적 에너지를 소진시키는 것입니다. 흥미로운 점은, 미국 기업들의 대처가 아직 충분치 않다는 것입니다. 설문에 응한 미국 직장인의 **79%는 회사가 툴 과다 문제나 직원 피로 해결을 위한 조치를 취한 적이 없다고 답변**했습니다[hcamag.com](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/tool-fatigue-why-digital-platforms-arent-delivering/555463#:~:text=Employers%20on%20tool%20fatigue). 이는 많은 미국 기업들이 빠르게 늘어난 디지털 툴을 방치한 채 직원들에게 사용을 강요하고 있으며, **체계적인 툴 정비나 “디지털 웰빙” 정책이 아직 미흡**함을 보여줍니다.

### 유럽: **영국, 독일, 프랑스**의 균형 모색

유럽은 전반적으로 **디지털 활용에 신중하고 워라밸(Work-Life Balance)을 중시**하는 지역으로 평가됩니다. 그럼에도 국가별 편차가 존재하는데, **프랑스**의 경우 흥미로운 아이러니가 발견됩니다. 프랑스 직원들은 주당 평균 **27시간을 사무실에서 근무**해 조사국 중 가장 긴 대면 근무시간을 보였지만, **주간 업무 마감 기한 준수율이 75%에 불과**하여 **25%는 마감 일을 지키지 못한다**고 답했습니다[nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/asana-anatomy-of-work-index-2022:-work-about-work-hampering-organizational-agility#:~:text=could%20alleviate%20burnout%20and%20imposter,last%20year). 이는 **업무 시간 자체는 길지만 집중도나 효율이 떨어지는 현상**을 시사하는데, 회의가 잦거나 보고 절차가 복잡해서 정작 산출물 납기가 밀리는 것 아니냐는 해석이 나옵니다.

반면 **영국**은 주당 **18시간만 사무실 근무**를 해 대면 근무시간이 가장 짧았고, **마감 준수율은 가장 높아** 업무 목표 달성도가 양호했습니다[nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/asana-anatomy-of-work-index-2022:-work-about-work-hampering-organizational-agility#:~:text=,3%20times%20in%20the). 이는 영국 기업들이 비교적 **유연근무와 원격 협업을 효율적으로 운영**하고 있음을 보여주는 대목입니다. **독일**은 **조직 내 업무 조율(work about work) 비중이 53%로 가장 낮게** 나타났습니다[nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/asana-anatomy-of-work-index-2022:-work-about-work-hampering-organizational-agility#:~:text=,about%20work%20has%20decreased%20globally). 다시 말해 독일 직원들은 전체 업무시간 중 절반가량만 이메일·회의 등 관리적 업무에 쓰고, 나머지 절반은 핵심 작업에 집중하고 있다는 의미입니다. 독일의 이러한 수치는 다른 나라에 비해 **업무 효율성이 높고 불필요한 디지털 업무 부담이 적다**는 긍정적 신호로 해석됩니다. 다만 동시에 독일은 전략 업무 시간도 줄어들었는데, 작년에 14%였던 전략 기획/고객대응 시간이 올해 7%로 절반 감소했다고 합니다[nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/asana-anatomy-of-work-index-2022:-work-about-work-hampering-organizational-agility#:~:text=,about%20work%20has%20decreased%20globally). 이는 **조직 효율은 높지만 장기 전략에 쓸 여력이 줄어든** 모습으로, 변화 대응 면에서 우려를 낳기도 합니다.

유럽 전반에서는 **근무시간 외 연결 자제** 등의 제도가 정착되어 가고 있습니다. 예를 들어 **프랑스**는 2017년부터 이른바 *“퇴근 후 연결 차단(right to disconnect)”* 권리를 법제화하여, 직원들이 퇴근 후 이메일이나 업무 메시지에 답하지 않을 권리를 보장하고 있습니다. 이러한 문화적 배경 덕분에 **유럽권 응답자들은 미국에 비해 업무용 알림에 덜 시달리고** 있는 편입니다. Asana 보고서에서도 미국을 제외한 다른 국가(일본, 독일 등)는 **업무 시간 외 이메일 확인 비율이 50% 안팎**으로, 미국(63%)보다 낮았습니다[hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/notification-fatigue-productivity-asana/623419/#:~:text=,a%20day%20to%20get%20tasks). 유럽인들은 **디지털 도구의 이점과 함께 부작용도 인지**하고 있어, **생산성보다는 직원 건강을 우선하는 균형 잡힌 접근**을 추구하는 경향이 있습니다.

### 호주: **번아웃 원인에 대한 인식과 대처**

**호주**는 지리적으로는 아시아태평양에 속하지만 업무 문화는 서구권과 유사합니다. 호주 근로자들은 **번아웃과 멘탈 헬스 이슈에 대한 인식**이 높으며, 이를 해소하기 위한 교육 및 멘토링을 중시합니다. Asana 조사에서 **호주 응답자들은 번아웃과 ‘임포스터 신드롬’(자신이 능력이 없다고 느끼는 현상)을 동시에 겪는 비율이 45%로 가장 높았고**, 이러한 어려움을 완화하기 위해 **멘토링·트레이닝 강화**를 요구하는 의견이 다른 지역보다 두드러졌습니다[nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/asana-anatomy-of-work-index-2022:-work-about-work-hampering-organizational-agility#:~:text=,least%20time%20in%20unnecessary%20meetings). 이는 호주 기업들이 **직원 지원 프로그램(EAP)**이나 **마음챙김 트레이닝** 등을 통해 디지털 시대의 스트레스를 완화하려는 노력이 필요함을 시사합니다.

한편 호주는 업무 도구 측면에서는 북미, 유럽의 중간 정도 수준으로 평가됩니다. 글로벌 조사 대상에 포함된 **7개국(미국, 영국, 프랑스, 독일, 일본, 싱가포르, 호주)** 중에서, 호주에 특화된 수치는 많이 공개되진 않았지만 전반적인 추세는 서구권과 유사합니다. **기업의 툴 통합 노력**도 진행 중인데, 실제 한 호주 HR 기술 매거진은 “직원들의 절반 이상이 툴 피로가 업무에 부정적 영향을 준다고 답했다”고 전하며[hcamag.com](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/tool-fatigue-why-digital-platforms-arent-delivering/555463#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20of%20employees,a%20negative%20impact%20at%20work)[hcamag.com](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/tool-fatigue-why-digital-platforms-arent-delivering/555463#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20%2856,They%20said%20it%20hinders%20their), **툴 통합과 간소화야말로 인프라 확장만큼이나 중요하다**는 현지 기업들의 인식 변화를 소개했습니다[hcamag.com](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/tool-fatigue-why-digital-platforms-arent-delivering/555463#:~:text=Employers%20on%20tool%20fatigue). 요컨대 호주도 이제 **“Less is more(적을수록 좋다)”**라는 메시지에 공감하며, **디지털 환경을 슬림화하고 본질적인 성과에 집중**하려는 방향으로 가고 있습니다[hcamag.com](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/tool-fatigue-why-digital-platforms-arent-delivering/555463#:~:text=The%20report%20highlighted%20that%20streamlining,as%20critical%20as%20scaling%20infrastructure).

## 산업별: 분야에 따른 디지털 도구 이용 양상과 문제점

### 교육: **에듀테크의 양날 – 편의 향상 vs 교사 번아웃**

**교육 분야**에서는 코로나19 팬데믹을 전후해 **원격 교육 기술과 에듀테크 도구의 폭발적 증가**가 있었습니다. LMS(Learning Management System), 화상강의 플랫폼, 학생 관리 앱 등 다양한 디지털 툴이 학교 현장에 도입되어 **교사들의 업무 방식이 급변**했죠. 그런데 한 연구 결과는 흥미로운 역설을 보여줍니다. **LMS를 활용한 학교의 교사들이 오히려 번아웃 수준이 더 높았다**는 것입니다[the74million.org](https://www.the74million.org/article/tech-aims-to-reduce-teacher-burnout-but-it-can-sometimes-make-it-worse/#:~:text=When%20we%20set%20out%20to,had%20higher%20rates%20of%20burnout). 2022년 미국 교사 779명을 조사하고 2024년에 발표된 이 연구에 따르면, 원래 기대와 달리 **디지털 툴이 교사의 업무를 줄여주기보다 오히려 “할 일 하나를 더 추가”하는 결과**가 나타났습니다[the74million.org](https://www.the74million.org/article/tech-aims-to-reduce-teacher-burnout-but-it-can-sometimes-make-it-worse/#:~:text=remote%20learning%20during%20the%20crisis,keep%20track%20of%20their%20coursework)[the74million.org](https://www.the74million.org/article/tech-aims-to-reduce-teacher-burnout-but-it-can-sometimes-make-it-worse/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20follow,another%20thing%20on%20teachers%E2%80%99%20plates). 예를 들어, 팬데믹 이전에는 교사가 종이로 작성한 수업계획안을 제출하면 되었지만, LMS 도입 후에도 **여전히 종이 문서를 내면서 동시에 해당 내용을 LMS에 이중으로 업로드**해야 했습니다[the74million.org](https://www.the74million.org/article/tech-aims-to-reduce-teacher-burnout-but-it-can-sometimes-make-it-worse/#:~:text=A%20telling%20example%20was%20seen,using%20a%20completely%20different%20format). 이처럼 **기존 업무 절차를 툴이 대체하지 못하고 중복되면서 교사의 부담만 가중**된 사례가 많았다는 것입니다. 연구진은 “기술을 도입하면서 **기존 업무를 덜어주지 않고 그대로 두면 번아웃으로 가는 지름길**”이라고 지적했습니다[the74million.org](https://www.the74million.org/article/tech-aims-to-reduce-teacher-burnout-but-it-can-sometimes-make-it-worse/#:~:text=versions%20to%20the%20learning%20management,using%20a%20completely%20different%20format).

또한 **유아·초등 교사들**의 경우, 도구가 현장 현실과 맞지 않아 오는 피로도도 컸습니다. 한 미국 유치원 교사는 *“우리반 5살 아이들은 들어올 때 10까지도 못 세지만, LMS에 접속하려면 6자리 아이디를 외워야 한다”*며 이로 인한 어려움이 번아웃에 일조한다고 털어놓았습니다[the74million.org](https://www.the74million.org/article/tech-aims-to-reduce-teacher-burnout-but-it-can-sometimes-make-it-worse/#:~:text=Teachers%20who%20taught%20early%20elementary,%E2%80%9D). 즉 기술이 **학습자의 발달 수준에 부합하지 않을 때** 교사의 스트레스가 늘어나는 것입니다. 이처럼 교육 산업에서는 **디지털 도구가 편의 향상에 기여하면서도, 현장의 추가 업무나 스트레스 요인이 될 수 있음**이 드러났습니다. 향후 학교 리더십은 새로운 플랫폼을 도입할 때 **기존 업무를 줄여주는 방향으로 통합 설계**를 해야 하며, **교사의 정신건강을 우선 고려한 변화 관리**가 필요하다는 제언이 나옵니다[the74million.org](https://www.the74million.org/article/tech-aims-to-reduce-teacher-burnout-but-it-can-sometimes-make-it-worse/#:~:text=If%20new%20technology%20is%20being,teachers%20to%20leave%20the%20field).

### IT/개발: **다양한 툴 속 “일하는 방식(work about work)” 증가**

**IT 업계와 소프트웨어 개발자**들은 업무상 **가장 많은 종류의 디지털 도구**를 다루는 직군 중 하나입니다. 버전관리 시스템(Git), 통합개발환경(IDE), 이슈트래커(JIRA 등), CI/CD 파이프라인 도구 등 개발을 위해 필수적인 툴만 해도 여러 가지이며, 여기에 협업을 위한 메신저, 프로젝트 관리, 클라우드 환경 등까지 합치면 개발자가 하루에 접하는 툴 수는 매우 많습니다. 한 업계 분석은 **“평균 개발자는 최소 4개의 핵심 도구를 사용한다”**고 언급하기도 합니다[medium.com](https://medium.com/@pratik0701ahu/developer-tools-market-analysis-d3d3c6667590#:~:text=For%20an%20average%20developer%2C%20he%2Fshe,JIRA%2C%20CI%2FCD%20tools%20for). 실제로 **다중 툴로 인한 작업 전환** 문제는 개발자들에게 심각한 과제입니다. *Harvard Business Review* 보도에 따르면 **지식 노동자가 여러 도구를 오가며 컨텍스트를 전환하는 바람에 잃는 시간이 연간 5주**에 달한다고 합니다[powell-software.com](https://powell-software.com/resources/blog/finance-intranet-fatigue-solution/#:~:text=The%20Problem%3A). 개발 직군은 이러한 **컨텍스트 스위칭 비용**이 큰 분야라 할 수 있습니다.

Asana의 연구에서는, **직장에서 사용하는 앱 개수가 많을수록 정보 놓침과 효율 저하 문제가 커진다**는 흥미로운 데이터도 있었습니다. **16개 이상**의 앱을 사용하는 근로자 그룹의 **25%는 중요한 메시지나 작업 지시를 놓친 경험이 있다**고 답했는데, **1~5개 앱만 쓰는 그룹에서는 그 비율이 8%**에 불과했습니다[nojitter.com](https://www.nojitter.com/digital-workplace/workers-skeptical-of-ai-seek-fewer-apps-and-value-human-centric-skills-most#:~:text=Related%3AZoom%20and%20Deloitte%3A%20Automate%20the,Work%20Before%20and%20After%20Meetings)[nojitter.com](https://www.nojitter.com/digital-workplace/workers-skeptical-of-ai-seek-fewer-apps-and-value-human-centric-skills-most#:~:text=,15). 또한 **앱을 너무 많이 쓰면 집중력에 문제를 느낀다**는 응답이 늘었는데, 16개 이상 사용하는 그룹의 23%가 **잦은 앱 전환으로 주의력이 감소**했다고 보고했습니다[nojitter.com](https://www.nojitter.com/digital-workplace/workers-skeptical-of-ai-seek-fewer-apps-and-value-human-centric-skills-most#:~:text=actions%2C%20compared%20to%208,15)[nojitter.com](https://www.nojitter.com/digital-workplace/workers-skeptical-of-ai-seek-fewer-apps-and-value-human-centric-skills-most#:~:text=,switching). **업무 효율 면에서도** 16개 이상 툴 사용자 중 26%가 **“툴 사이를 오가느라 비효율이 커졌다”**고 느낀 반면, 소수의 앱만 쓰는 그룹은 이런 답변이 훨씬 적었습니다[nojitter.com](https://www.nojitter.com/digital-workplace/workers-skeptical-of-ai-seek-fewer-apps-and-value-human-centric-skills-most#:~:text=,switching)[nojitter.com](https://www.nojitter.com/digital-workplace/workers-skeptical-of-ai-seek-fewer-apps-and-value-human-centric-skills-most#:~:text=,efficient%20because%20of%20app%20switching). 이러한 데이터는 주로 **개발·IT 직무처럼 다종다양한 툴을 쓰는 직장인들의 고충**을 대변하는 것이라 볼 수 있습니다.

한편 최신 동향으로 **AI 도구의 등장**도 개발자들의 툴 스택(stack)을 늘리고 있습니다. 2023년 *Stack Overflow* 개발자 설문에 따르면 **84%의 개발자가 AI 코딩 도구를 이미 사용 중이거나 사용할 계획**이라고 답해 전년(76%)보다 증가했습니다[survey.stackoverflow.co](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai#:~:text=AI%20,of). 코파일럿(Copilot)이나 챗GPT 같은 AI가 코딩 생산성을 높여주지만, 이는 또다른 **새로운 툴의 추가**를 의미하기도 합니다. 실제 **AI 도구 난립(AI sprawl)** 현상에 대한 우려도 나오는데, 한 보고서에서는 **직원의 77.5%가 만약 AI 툴의 절반을 없앨 수 있다면 무관하거나 오히려 안도할 것**이라고 밝히기도 했습니다[clickup.com](https://clickup.com/blog/ai-sprawl-survey/#:~:text=Workers%20Are%20Begging%20for%20Fewer,Tools%2C%20Not%20More)[clickup.com](https://clickup.com/blog/ai-sprawl-survey/#:~:text=The%20breakdown%20reveals%20the%20depth,of%20tool%20fatigue). 이는 개발자를 포함한 지식노동자들이 **툴 개수가 줄어드는 것을 “해방”으로 인식**하고 있음을 보여줍니다. 결국 IT 업계에서도 **핵심 업무에 필요한 도구 중심으로 스택을 슬림화**하고, 중복 기능의 툴은 정리하는 **디지털 미니멀리즘**이 요구되고 있습니다.

### 금융: **복잡한 시스템과 “인트라넷 피로(Intranet Fatigue)”**

- *금융 산업(은행·증권·보험 등)**은 전통적으로도 IT 시스템 활용도가 높았지만, 최근 들어 그 **복잡성이 더욱 증가**한 분야입니다. 회계 시스템, 리스크 관리 도구, 고객 관계 관리(CRM), 규제 준수(Compliance) 보고 시스템 등 **업무별로 특화된 소프트웨어**를 운영하고 있고, 보안 이슈로 인해 사내 인트라넷에 수많은 SaaS 애플리케이션이 도입되었습니다. **평균 기업이 사용하는 SaaS 애플리케이션 수는 2020년 80개에서 2023년 112개로 급증**했다는 보고가 있습니다[powell-software.com](https://powell-software.com/resources/blog/finance-intranet-fatigue-solution/#:~:text=In%20the%20fast,due%20to%20inefficient%2C%20disconnected%20systems). 금융회사라고 예외가 아니어서, 직원들은 **규제 보고, 고객관리, 재무분석을 위해 여러 프로그램을 수시로 넘나드는 현실**입니다[powell-software.com](https://powell-software.com/resources/blog/finance-intranet-fatigue-solution/#:~:text=frustrated%20and%20disengaged%20due%20to,inefficient%2C%20disconnected%20systems). 한 금융 디지털 워크플레이스 분석은 이러한 상태를 **“인트라넷 피로”**로 칭하며, **여러 분절된 시스템을 관리하다 보니 좌절감과 시간 낭비, 생산성 저하로 이어진다**고 지적했습니다[powell-software.com](https://powell-software.com/resources/blog/finance-intranet-fatigue-solution/#:~:text=Efficiency%20is%20critical%20in%20finance%2C,focus%20on%20what%20matters%20most)[powell-software.com](https://powell-software.com/resources/blog/finance-intranet-fatigue-solution/#:~:text=In%20the%20fast,due%20to%20inefficient%2C%20disconnected%20systems).

컨텍스트 전환 비용도 막대합니다. **여러 애플리케이션을 넘나들며 동일한 데이터를 중복 입력**하거나 서로 다른 대시보드를 확인해야 하는 탓에 프로세스가 비효율적인 경우가 많습니다. 금융권 직원들도 이러한 **툴 과다로 인한 피로감**을 강하게 느끼는 것으로 보입니다. 현업의 목소리를 반영하듯, 최근 **금융사들은 통합 디지털 업무환경 구축**에 관심을 가지기 시작했습니다. 예를 들어 **Single Sign-On(SSO)**을 통해 한 번 로그인으로 모든 업무툴에 접근하게 하여 **로그인 피로**를 줄이고, **업무 포털을 하나로 통합**하여 여기에서 곧바로 필요한 시스템을 불러쓰게 하는 등의 개선입니다[powell-software.com](https://powell-software.com/resources/blog/finance-intranet-fatigue-solution/#:~:text=The%20Solution%3A)[powell-software.com](https://powell-software.com/resources/blog/finance-intranet-fatigue-solution/#:~:text=%2A%20Single%20Sign,document%20approvals%20and%20compliance%20reporting). 한 보고서에 따르면 이렇게 **도구를 한 곳에 모으는 통합 플랫폼**을 도입한 은행은 **컴플라이언스 보고에 드는 시간을 30% 줄이고, IT 지원 티켓(문의)을 40% 감소**시키는 성과를 거두었다고 합니다[powell-software.com](https://powell-software.com/resources/blog/finance-intranet-fatigue-solution/#:~:text=Real). 이는 **분산된 금융 IT 환경을 정리해 직원들의 디지털 피로를 줄이고자 하는 노력**이 효과를 낼 수 있음을 보여줍니다.

결국 금융 업계에서는 **“스프롤(sprawl, 난립) 관리”**가 화두가 되고 있습니다. **여러 시스템이 제각기 도입된 상태에서는 직원들이 같은 작업을 여러 번 입력**해야 하거나 시스템 간 불일치를 사람이 수작업으로 조정해야 하므로 피로와 오류가 누적됩니다. 이를 해소하기 위해 **일원화된 업무 플랫폼**, **자동 연계(RPA, API 통합)** 등이 추진되고 있으며,  **ガート너** 등 컨설팅 기관도 금융 리더들에게 **“변화 피로(change fatigue)”**를 고려해 프로젝트 우선순위를 정하라는 조언을 하고 있습니다[gartner.com](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-02-27-gartner-says-finance-leaders-should-factor-change-fatigue-into-project-planning#:~:text=Gartner%20Says%20Finance%20Leaders%20Should,to%20reprioritize%20their%20project)[financialexecutives.org](https://www.financialexecutives.org/FEI-Daily/March-2025/How-To-Address-the-Growing-Challenge-of-CFO-Decisi.aspx#:~:text=decision%20fatigue%2C%20enhance%20efficiency%20and,improve%20strategic%20financial%20planning). **파편화된 디지털 환경을 정돈**하는 것이 금융권의 중요한 과제로 부상한 것입니다.

### 제조·헬스케어 등: **현장 디지털화와 예기치 않은 부작용**

**제조업** 분야(예: 반도체, 자동차, 조선, 화학 등)도 최근 **디지털 전환**의 물결을 강하게 받고 있습니다. 스마트 팩토리, IoT 센서, MES(제조실행시스템), CAD/CAM 설계툴 등 **공장 현장과 연구개발에 다양한 디지털 도구**가 도입되어 생산성 향상을 도모하고 있습니다. 대부분의 제조 기업 임원들은 **디지털 도구가 공정 가시성을 높여준다**는 데 동의하고 있고[pwc.com](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/business-transformation/digital-supply-chain-survey.html#:~:text=PwC%27s%202025%20Digital%20Trends%20in,Embracing%20digital%20manufacturing), 실제 **스마트 제조 도입으로 생산성이 20% 개선되었다**는 보고도 있습니다[prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deloitte-survey-reveals-smart-manufacturing-is-driving-advantage-but-needs-focused-investment-and-implementation-302443462.html#:~:text=Deloitte%20Survey%20Reveals%20Smart%20Manufacturing,in%20employee). 하지만 현장 근로자 관점에서 보면, 새로운 시스템 학습과 **기존 작업 방식 변경으로 인한 스트레스**도 존재합니다. 제조업체 대상 조사에서 **응답자의 66%**가 “우리 경쟁사가 우리보다 디지털화에 앞서 있다”며 압박감을 느낀다고 했고[l2l.com](https://www.l2l.com/blog/digital-transformation-in-manufacturing-industry#:~:text=,their%20competitors%20invest%20in%20digitalization), **절반 가량의 일선 작업자만이 현재 직무 만족도가 높다**고 답한 조사도 있습니다[l2l.com](https://www.l2l.com/blog/digital-transformation-in-manufacturing-industry#:~:text=biggest%20barriers%20to%20digital%20transformation). 이는 **디지털 도입으로 인한 업무 변화에 대한 불안, 교육의 어려움, 조직 문화적 저항** 등이 복합적으로 작용한 결과로 보입니다.

예를 들어 한 전통 제조 업체가 생산 관리 시스템을 도입했을 때, 현장 관리자들은 종전의 수기 장부 관리와 신규 전산 시스템 병행으로 한동안 **업무량이 오히려 늘어나는 경험**을 했습니다. 이때 직원들의 피로가 커져 **“디지털화가 오히려 일을 복잡하게 만든다”**는 불만이 나왔고, 결국 회사는 한동안 **구 시스템과 신 시스템의 데이터 연동 작업**에 추가 인력을 투입하며 과도기를 관리해야 했습니다. 이러한 사례는 제조업 디지털 전환에서 흔히 나타나는 **러닝 커브(Learning Curve)**와 **일시적 업무 과부하**를 보여줍니다. 다행히 시간이 지나 새로운 프로세스에 익숙해지고 나면 **품질 데이터 실시간 확인, 서류 작업 감소 등의 이점**이 나타나지만, **초기 정착 단계에서의 직원 피로 관리**가 중요한 과제임을 알 수 있습니다.

**의료/헬스케어** 분야 역시 디지털화의 혜택과 함께 커다란 **인력 피로 문제**가 나타나는 영역입니다. 대표적인 것이 **전자건강기록(EHR)** 시스템입니다. 병원과 의원에 EHR이 확산되면서 의사들은 환자 진료 내용과 처방을 컴퓨터에 꼼꼼히 기록하게 되었는데, 이에 따른 **문서 업무 폭증**이 의사들의 번아웃 요인으로 지목됩니다. 미국 의료협회(AMA)가 지원한 연구에 따르면, **외래 진료 의사가 환자 대면 8시간을 하면 그 배후에 5시간 넘게 EHR 작업을 하고 있다**는 통계가 있습니다[ama-assn.org](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital-health/digging-data-cut-ehr-burdens-drive-burnout#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20for,five%20hours%20in%20the%20EHR). 일선 의사들의 체감으로도 “진료 1시간당 1~2시간은 서류 작성”이라는 말이 나올 정도로, **환자를 보는 시간보다 문서 입력과 클릭에 소비하는 시간이 많아진 상황**입니다[mayoclinicproceedings.org](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(19)30836-5/fulltext#:~:text=The%20Association%20Between%20Perceived%20Electronic,as%20well%20as%20an). 특히 업무 시간 후 집에 가서까지 차트를 입력하는 이른바 *“파자마 차임(pajama time)”*이 일상화되어, **주 5시간 이하로 근무시간 외 차트질을 하는 의사가 6시간 이상 하는 의사보다 번아웃 위험이 절반밖에 안 되었다**는 연구도 있습니다[academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/28/5/960/6242740#:~:text=,to%20those%20charting%20%E2%89%A56%20hours). 결국 EHR 사용 시간이 많을수록 번아웃 위험이 높아지는 상관관계가 확인된 것입니다[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10134123/#:~:text=Care%20pmc,time%20pressures%2C%20chaotic%20work).

게다가 팬데믹 이후 **환자와의 디지털 소통(메시지, 이메일)**이 증가하면서 의사·간호사들의 부담이 가중되었습니다. 연구에 따르면 **팬데믹 전보다 의사들이 EHR을 통해 받는 환자 메시지의 양이 크게 늘어났다**고 합니다[ama-assn.org](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital-health/digging-data-cut-ehr-burdens-drive-burnout#:~:text=,predict%20physician%20departure%20from%20practice). 환자 입장에서는 온라인으로 질문을 보내는 것이 편리해졌지만, 의료진 입장에서는 기존 진료 외에 답변해야 할 디지털 업무가 늘어난 것입니다. 이로 인해 미국의 일부 병원들은 **환자 메시지 상담에 대해 소액의 수수료를 청구**하거나, **의료 보조 인력을 통해 1차 대응**하는 등의 조치를 시도하기도 합니다.

이렇듯 의료 분야에서는 **생명을 다루는 업무 특성상 디지털 도구의 도입에도 신중**해야 하고, 무턱대고 최신 IT 시스템을 쓰기보다는 **의료진의 업무 흐름을 재설계**하는 접근이 필요합니다. 최근에는 **의료 AI**를 통해 문서 작업을 돕거나, **버추얼 스크라이브(virtual scribe)**로 의사가 환자 대화에 집중하면 AI가 자동으로 차트를 작성하게 하는 기술도 도입되고 있습니다[ama-assn.org](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital-health/digging-data-cut-ehr-burdens-drive-burnout#:~:text=,predict%20physician%20departure%20from%20practice)[ama-assn.org](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital-health/digging-data-cut-ehr-burdens-drive-burnout#:~:text=COVID,predict%20physician%20departure%20from%20practice). 이러한 **디지털 보조 인력** 활용이 정착되면 의료진의 디지털 피로를 크게 줄여줄 것으로 기대됩니다. 다만 그 전까지는 **EHR 인터페이스 개선, 불필요한 클릭 감소, 팀 단위의 문서 작업 분담** 등으로 현장의 피로를 경감시켜야 한다는 지적입니다.

### 기타 분야 및 공통 이슈

그 밖에도 **영업, 마케팅, HR** 등 각 부서별로 디지털 도구와 관련한 특유의 이슈가 존재합니다.

- **영업 부서**의 경우, CRM 소프트웨어(예: 세일즈포스)부터 이메일, 화상회의, 견적서 작성 툴에 이르기까지 다양한 **세일즈 테크(SalesTech)**를 활용합니다. 문제는 도구가 너무 많아 **영업사원들이 정작 고객과 대면하여 판매 활동을 하는 시간은 주당 28%에 불과**하다는 조사 결과입니다[salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/sales-research-2023/#:~:text=Sales%20operations%20is%20tasked%20with,increasing%20productivity). 나머지 시간은 데이터를 CRM에 입력하거나 사내 보고, 자료 찾기 등에 보내고 있다는 뜻입니다. Salesforce의 글로벌 설문에 따르면 **영업팀은 딜(Deal)을 성사시키기 위해 평균 10개의 툴을 사용**하고 있으며, **영업사원의 66%(약 3분의 2)가 사용 툴이 너무 많아 압도당하고 있다고** 호소했습니다[salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/sales-research-2023/#:~:text=strategy%20%E2%80%94%20up%20from%2054,in%202020)[salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/sales-research-2023/#:~:text=One%20area%20of%20focus%20is,by%20the%20number%20of%20tools). 이에 따라 **90%의 영업 조직은 향후 1년 내 기술 스택을 통합할 계획**이라고 답했는데[salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/sales-research-2023/#:~:text=they%E2%80%99re%20overwhelmed%20by%20the%20number,of%20tools), 이는 영업 현장에서 **툴 통폐합을 통한 생산성 향상이 시급**하다는 인식이 확산된 결과입니다. 예를 들어 일부 기업은 영업 활동을 팀즈(Teams)나 슬랙(Slack) 같은 협업툴과 CRM을 연동해 **영업사원이 한 화면에서 고객 대화와 CRM 업데이트를 동시에 처리**하도록 하거나, **영업 지원 전담 부서(Sales Ops)**를 두어 툴 관리와 데이터를 정리해주는 추세입니다[salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/sales-research-2023/#:~:text=The%20rise%20of%20sales%20operations,in%202020)[salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/sales-research-2023/#:~:text=stage%20as%20organizations%20emphasize%20efficiency,in%202020).
- **마케팅 부서**는 소셜미디어 관리, 광고 집행, 웹분석, 디자인 툴 등 광범위한 디지털 도구를 다룹니다. 마케팅 담당자들은 여러 플랫폼의 계정을 오가며 캠페인을 진행해야 하기에 **툴 피로도**가 높은 편입니다. 다만 마케팅 분야는 비교적 새로운 협업툴 도입에 적극적이고, 업무 자동화를 위한 스크립팅 등을 활용하는 등 **툴 활용 숙련도가 높아** 스스로 워크플로 효율화를 꾀하기도 합니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 마케팅 역시 **데이터와 툴이 파편화**되어 성과 측정이나 협업에 어려움을 겪는 일이 많습니다. 예를 들어 **캠페인 성과 수치를 일일이 엑셀로 통합**하거나 **디자인 파일을 여러 버전으로 주고받느라 시간 낭비**를 경험하는 것이 흔합니다. 이에 **마케팅 허브**나 **올인원 콘텐츠 관리 플랫폼**에 대한 수요가 증가하고 있습니다.
- *HR 부서(인사·총무)**는 전사 직원 데이터를 다루는 입장이라 여러 사내 시스템과 연동이 필요합니다. 인사관리시스템(HRIS), 급여 시스템, 평가 시스템, 채용관리 ATS 등 각 기능별 솔루션이 존재하지만, 최근에는 이를 한 데 묶은 **통합 HR 플랫폼**이 부상하고 있습니다. 다행히도 HR 담당자들은 다른 직군에 비해 “디지털 툴 피로”를 심각하게 토로하는 경우는 적은 편입니다. 앞서 Lokalise 조사에서도 **HR/급여 시스템을 가장 골치 아픈 툴로 꼽은 응답은 8%에 불과**하여, 이메일(47%)이나 메신저(35%) 등에 비하면 낮은 수준이었습니다[hcamag.comhcamag.com](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/tool-fatigue-why-digital-platforms-arent-delivering/555463#:~:text=,taking%20%287). 이는 HR 업무가 주로 정형화된 내부 프로세스 위주이고 대면 소통이 많았던 탓에, 상대적으로 디지털 도구로 인한 스트레스가 덜했기 때문으로 보입니다. 그러나 HR 부서도 코로나 이후 재택근무 관리, 직원 복지 앱, 온라인 교육 플랫폼 등 **새로운 디지털 HR 도구 도입**이 빠르게 진행되어 앞으로는 툴 통합 이슈가 본격화될 가능성이 있습니다. 또한 **사내 세대 간 디지털 격차**도 HR이 관리해야 할 과제입니다. 한 설문에서 **전체 직원의 92%가 “사내 디지털 도구로 인한 갈등을 겪은 적 있다”**고 답했는데, 예를 들면 **팀 내 커뮤니케이션에서 말투 오해(42%)나 응답 시간 차이로 인한 마찰** 등이 대표적이었습니다[gttkorea.com](https://www.gttkorea.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=9437#:~:text=%EC%A7%81%EC%9E%A5%EC%9D%B8%2092,%EC%9D%BC%EC%B9%98%ED%95%98%EC%A7%80%20%EC%95%8A%EB%8A%94%20%EC%9D%91%EB%8B%B5%20%EC%8B%9C%EA%B0%84). 젊은 직원은 채팅 메시지로 빨리 답을 주고받길 원하는 반면 고연령 직원은 이메일로 장문의 보고를 선호하는 등 **디지털 업무방식의 차이**가 충돌을 낳는 것이죠. 따라서 HR은 **조직 내 디지털 협업 문화 정립**과 함께 **직원들이 합의된 도구를 효과적으로 쓰도록 교육**하는 역할을 할 필요가 있습니다.
- **프리랜서/긱 워커**들도 디지털 도구와 씨름하는 사례가 늘고 있습니다. 여러 클라이언트와 프로젝트를 동시에 수행하는 프리랜서들은 **각 고객사마다 다른 협업툴**을 사용해야 하는 경우가 많습니다. 예를 들어 한 클라이언트는 Slack을, 다른 하나는 Teams나 구글 드라이브를 쓰는 식입니다. 결국 프리랜서는 **각종 플랫폼에 모두 능통**해야 하고, 작업 내용과 파일을 **본인 PC와 모든 외부 툴에 이중으로 관리**해야 하는 어려움이 있습니다. 이에 일부 프리랜서는 개인적으로 Notion이나 Trello 같은 툴을 활용해 **자신만의 대시보드에 모든 업무를 모아 관리**하기도 합니다. 또한 프리랜서는 시간관리가 중요하기에, **과도한 앱 알림을 끄고 자신의 생산성 리듬에 맞춰 일하는 디지털 미니멀리즘**을 실천하는 경우도 있습니다.

이렇듯 직무별로 디지털 도구 사용 양상은 다르지만 공통적으로 **“너무 많고 복잡한 툴을 줄이고 싶다”**는 요구는 한 목소리입니다. 아래 **그림 1**은 **직원들이 느끼는 업무 툴 피로도의 원인**을 보여줍니다. **가장 피로를 유발하는 도구 유형은 이메일(47%)**로 나타났고, 메신저 채팅(35%), 화상회의(22%)가 그 뒤를 이었습니다[hcamag.com](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/tool-fatigue-why-digital-platforms-arent-delivering/555463#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20report%2C%20the,Others%20cited). 이는 **커뮤니케이션 도구**들이 업무 몰입을 방해하고 스트레스를 준다는 인식이 높음을 뜻합니다. 다음으로 일정 관리(17%), 파일 공유(16%) 등 협업 조율 툴들이 꼽혔고, **CRM 영업소프트웨어(9%)**, **고객지원 티켓 시스템(10%)**, **HR 시스템(8%)** 등 **특정 부서 전문툴들도 적지 않은 비중**을 차지했습니다[hcamag.com](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/tool-fatigue-why-digital-platforms-arent-delivering/555463#:~:text=%2A%20Chat%20or%20messaging%20%2835,taking%20%287). **지식관리/노트 공유툴(7%)**도 언급되어, 정보가 여기저기 흩어져 찾기 어려운 데 따른 피로감을 보여줍니다. 이는 앞서 논의한 바와 같이 **영업, 지원, HR 등 각 부서별로 자신들의 핵심 시스템에서 오는 부담**이 있음을 숫자로 보여줍니다.

## 결론: **툴 통합과 디지털 최소화로의 방향 전환**

지역·산업·직무를 막론하고 **디지털 도구에 대한 의존 증대와 그로 인한 피로 누적 현상**이 광범위하게 관찰되고 있습니다. 그러나 동시에 이러한 문제를 인식하고 **해결하려는 움직임**도 곳곳에서 나타나고 있습니다. 많은 기업과 전문가들은 **“필요한 몇 가지 핵심 툴에 집중하고 나머지는 과감히 줄이는 것”이 디지털 시대의 생산성 향상의 열쇠**라고 말합니다[hcamag.com](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/tool-fatigue-why-digital-platforms-arent-delivering/555463#:~:text=The%20report%20highlighted%20that%20streamlining,as%20critical%20as%20scaling%20infrastructure). 실제로 다수의 직원들은 툴 수가 줄어드는 것을 반기고 있습니다. 앞서 소개한 설문에서 **직원의 78% 정도(53.6%+23.9%)는 만약 업무용 툴이 절반으로 줄어든다면 무덤덤하거나 오히려 안도감을 느낄 것**이라고 답했습니다[clickup.com](https://clickup.com/blog/ai-sprawl-survey/#:~:text=consolidation%20Image%3A%20ClickUp%20survey%20on,sentiment%20on%20AI%20tool%20consolidation). 불과 15%만이 툴 감소에 부정적이었고[clickup.com](https://clickup.com/blog/ai-sprawl-survey/#:~:text=The%20breakdown%20reveals%20the%20depth,of%20tool%20fatigue), 이는 **대다수가 툴 통합과 정리를 “업무 해방”으로 여긴다**는 뜻입니다. 실제 **Salesforce 조사에서는 94%의 영업 조직이 향후 1년간 툴을 통합하여 셀러들이 고객에게 더 집중하도록 할 계획**이라고 밝혔습니다[salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/sales-research-2023/#:~:text=%2A%20With%20nearly%2070,selling%20and%20connecting%20with%20customers)[salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/sales-research-2023/#:~:text=now%2C%20including%3A).

또 다른 해결책은 **자동화와 AI의 적절한 활용**입니다. 직원들이 번거롭다고 느끼는 업무 중 상당 부분이 **정보 찾기, 중복 입력, 단순 응대** 등 자동화 가능한 영역입니다. 예컨대 이메일 분류나 회의 일정 조율은 AI에게 맡기고, 정작 사람은 창의성과 전략이 필요한 일에 전념하도록 하는 방향입니다. 다만 **AI 역시 “또 하나의 툴”이 될 수 있기 때문에 기존 툴과의 통합 전략이 중요**합니다[nojitter.com](https://www.nojitter.com/digital-workplace/workers-skeptical-of-ai-seek-fewer-apps-and-value-human-centric-skills-most#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20more%20recent,the%20dots%20to%20prior%20research)[nojitter.com](https://www.nojitter.com/digital-workplace/workers-skeptical-of-ai-seek-fewer-apps-and-value-human-centric-skills-most#:~:text=vendors%20began%20to%20connect%20the,dots%20to%20prior%20research). AI 도구를 현 업무흐름과 별개로 도입하면 오히려 직원이 일일이 맥락을 새로 설명해야 하는 부담이 생기므로, **핵심 업무 맥락에 녹아드는 형태의 AI 통합**이 필요합니다[clickup.com](https://clickup.com/blog/ai-sprawl-survey/#:~:text=AI%20Operating%20in%20the%20Dark%3A,Zero%20Context)[clickup.com](https://clickup.com/blog/ai-sprawl-survey/#:~:text=When%20AI%20can%E2%80%99t%20access%20the,exists%20in%20their%20work%20systems). 이를 위해 많은 협업툴 벤더들이 AI를 기존 플랫폼에 내장시키거나, 워크플로 자동화 기능을 확대하고 있습니다.

마지막으로, **디지털 문화와 정책 측면**에서도 변화가 요구됩니다. **“항상 온라인”인 문화에서 벗어나 업무 시간과 비업무 시간을 분리**하려는 움직임이 강화되어야 합니다. 특히 팬데믹 이후 재택근무로 경계가 흐려진 상황에서, 기업 차원에서 **야간과 주말에는 메일·메신저 사용을 자제**하고 **불필요한 회의를 줄이는 가이드**를 만들 필요가 있습니다. 앞서 유럽 사례에서 보았듯 이러한 **제도적 장치(예: 퇴근 후 연결차단권 보장)**가 장기적으로 직원의 웰빙을 높이고 업무 집중도도 오히려 향상시키는 효과를 기대할 수 있습니다.

요약하면, 전 세계적으로 **디지털 업무툴에 대한 과잉 의존을 탈피하고 “정제된(tool rationalization)” 디지털 환경을 구축**하려는 수요가 높아지고 있습니다. 이는 어떤 첨단 기술을 도입하느냐만큼이나 **무엇을 덜어내고 단순화하느냐의 문제**입니다. 향후 성공적인 기업과 조직은 각 지역·업계의 특성을 고려하면서도 공통적으로 **디지털 툴을 전략적으로 선정하고 통합 관리**하여 직원들의 **디지털 피로를 최소화**하는 곳이 될 것입니다. 결국 **사람이 본연의 가치 있는 일에 집중할 수 있게 해주는 기술**만이 살아남고, 그렇지 않은 도구는 도태될 것입니다. 지금은 그 전환점에 있으며, **디지털 최소주의(Digital Minimalism)**가 개인과 조직의 생산성 담론에서 중요한 화두로 떠오르고 있습니다.
